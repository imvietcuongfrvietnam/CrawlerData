The legislation, known as OKHB3594, was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt and sponsored by four Republicans: State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.
The bill prohibits any restrictions or bans on using self-custody or hardware wallets to store digital assets, which ensures that individuals in Oklahoma have the freedom to control and safeguard their own digital assets without interference from third parties.
The legislation also allows Oklahomans to engage in both home-based and industrial crypto mining as long as they comply with local noise ordinances.
The digital asset self-custody bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024.
One notable provision of the bill is the exemption of crypto miners from obtaining a money transmitter license.

This means that individuals involved in home digital asset mining or running digital asset mining businesses, as well as those engaged in staking or staking as a service, are not required to acquire a license typically associated with financial transactions.
Additionally, the bill outlaws discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses, ensuring fair treatment in terms of energy costs.
The legislation also addresses the use of digital assets as a payment method.
Oklahoma residents can utilize cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services without being subjected to additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or charges imposed solely because of the use of digital assets in transactions.
Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, emphasized the bill’s importance in protecting fundamental Bitcoin rights.
“Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families,” he wrote in a post on X. “This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets.”

Countries worldwide are increasingly considering confiscating crypto assets for debt collection from taxpayers.
South Korean tax officials in the city of Pohang revealed plans to seize crypto from 5,208 residents who failed to pay local taxes.
Per local reports, the individuals have all evaded local tax bills worth $370 or above.
The drive saw tax officials seize almost $29 million in coins and fiat in 2023.
Likewise, the Spanish Ministry of Finance wants to enable the seizure of digital assets to settle tax debts.
Under the leadership of María Jesús Montero, the ministry is currently working on legislative reforms to the General Tax Law.
The proposed changes would grant the Spanish Tax Agency the authority to identify and control crypto assets owned by taxpayers with outstanding debts.","May 17, 2024 16:54 EDT","","Ruholamin Haqshanas",""

In a character reference for the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, Trabucco described Salame as an “affable” and “complex” person who “doesn’t deserve to be defined by his worst actions.”
“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes,” Trabucco wrote. “He’s acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”
Trabucco further said that he had hoped Salame would receive a “fair” sentence in relation to the digital asset scandal, referring to him as a “sought-after employee in the crypto space.”

Salame, who recently requested a sentencing length of eighteen months in prison, pled guilty to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting license and conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions back in September 2023.
Salame has largely distanced himself from the doomed crypto exchange, with lawyers for the FTX executive arguing that he had limited knowledge of the company’s $8 billion fraud scheme.
“As was true for thousands of other FTX employees, customers, investors, and lenders, Ryan lost years of hard work and nearly his entire net worth almost instantaneously,” the court filing read. “Ryan, who was not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle, was unaware of the crimes at the center of this case.”
Salame’s unlawful political contributions charge stems from over 300 secret donations totaling tens of millions of dollars made by Bankman-Fried, with the willing participation of the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO and the company’s Head of Engineering, Nishad Singh.
Prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried, who is currently serving 25 years in prison for orchestrating the fraud scheme, used the straw donor scheme to levy influence and power to pro-crypto politicians.
Of course, these donations were largely funded by FTX customers’ money, which Bankman-Fried stole and used to fund venture investments, real estate purchases, and more while claiming investors’ funds were safe.
“He built a pyramid of deceit on a foundation of lies and false promises,” U.S. prosecutors claimed during SBF’s trial. “And when it collapsed, it left a trail of destruction in its wake.”
Salame’s sentencing will take place at Manhattan federal court on May 28 at 11 a.m. He is facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.","May 17, 2024 16:40 EDT","","Julia Smith",""
"https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-launches-e-cny-wallets-for-payments.htm","https://cryptonews.com/","News Article","","Hong Kong Launches Personal e-CNY Wallets For Cross-Border Payments","Hong Kong became the first region outside mainland China to allow users to open digital wallets and hold China’s CBDC e-CNY, otherwise known as the digital yuan on Friday.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s central bank, announced that permanent residents and foreign nationals living in Hong Kong can now open e-CNY wallets using their local mobile phone numbers with four major mainland Chinese state-owned banks.
The accredited banks licensed to facilitate the CBDC wallet opening are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Construction Bank, and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.
HKMA and People’s Bank of China have expanded the scope of the e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong.

— HKMA 香港金融管理局 (@hkmagovhk) May 17, 2024

“Unlike conventional digital wallets, the e-CNY wallet has the full endorsement of the People’s Bank of China,”Howard Lee, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Deputy Chief Executive, emphasize.
He added that the key objective of the digital yuan is to provide Hong Kong residents with a “safe and convenient option for cross-border payments” when traveling to the Greater Bay Area integration zone, which comprises Hong Kong, Macao, and nine cities in Guangdong province.
Recall that Crypto News reported in January 2024 that the Chinese central bank plans to expand the digital yuan to Hong Kong to foster cross-border payment.
Hong Kong’s retailers are concerned, however. They believe there is more demand for mobile payment in mainland cities like Shenzhen, where shopping and dining are predominant, which could divert consumption away from the city.
Currently, around 300 merchants in Hong Kong accept e-CNY payments, subject to certain limits. Individual wallet balances are capped at ¥10,000 ($1,380), and single transactions are limited to ¥2,000, while annual spending is restricted to ¥50,000.
HK residents can top up their wallets via Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS), which has been integrated with the e-CNY payment infrastructure.
Senior economist at Natixis Hong Kong Gary Ng described the development as “a big move compared to the past” in promoting the yuan’s internationalization. He expects more companies to adopt the system going forward.
According to the latest figures released by the People’s Bank of China, domestic transactions facilitated by the digital yuan reached a staggering 1.8 trillion yuan (approximately $249 billion) as of the end of June 2023. The surge in usage has been driven by the opening of over 120 million individual e-CNY digital wallets nationwide, with over 29 million digital yuan wallets opened in Suzhou.
Despite these growths, many workers actively convert their e-CNY into fiat currency, indicating a clear preference for physical cash. As CryptoNews reported, Chinese workers are hesitant to use CBDC due to its perceived lack of utility and privacy concerns.","May 17, 2024 16:33 EDT","","Jimmy Aki",""

As of the end of Q1, more than 900 institutions based in the United States had disclosed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shareholdings exceeding $100 million, equating to $10.7 billion combined.
In addition, leading asset management firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have launched tokenized treasury funds. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.
A bi-annual survey conducted by KPMG in Canada further found that institutional investors located in the region greatly increased their crypto holdings in 2023. According to KPMG’s survey, 22% more financial services organizations offered crypto asset products and services to clients last year than in previous years.

While notable, digital asset data is still a challenge for institutions.
Isabella Henderson, Director of Product Strategy at Amberdata, told Cryptonews that digital asset data is dense and complex.
“Each crypto exchange uses different tickers and hundreds of thousands of asset instruments,” said Henderson. “This makes consistency and reliability a challenge for institutions.”
Henderson pointed out that in traditional finance, standardized security masters and asset references solve these challenges by aligning front, middle, and back offices.
Yet she noted that the digital asset space lacks such solutions, resulting in a fragmented view of the crypto sector for institutions.
To solve this problem, Amerberdata recently launched an asset reference and classification tool. Known as “ARC,” this is an institutional-grade security master database for digital assets.
A security master database is a data store that contains reference data about financial products. Such a tool is used by market participants to organize their records across trading, risk, clearing, and settlement operations.

— Amberdata (@Amberdataio) May 16, 2024

Henderson explained that ARC is an open-source dataset that enables financial institutions to segment and view the digital asset sector consistently.
“By combining reference details, classification, and categorization, ARC is a solution that provides transparency into the operations and use cases of any digital asset,” she remarked.
Henderson elaborated that ARC unifies front, middle, and back offices for institutions holding digital assets. This is done through data collected by Amberdata, which tracks traded crypto pairs across over 150,000 spot, options, and futures instruments.
“ARC shows token addresses, contract and trade specifications, price limits, exploits, and more,” said Henderson. “ARC IDs also map an asset’s associated instruments across the digital asset ecosystem, using a tagging classification system to flexibly classify industries and proper use cases.”
Henderson believes that such a tool can help institutions with analysis and reference, trading, and for other instances.
“For example, ARC will help institutions keep records of the highly dynamic universe of digital assets with a repository of accurate asset and classification information for reference and analysis,” she said. “It can also optimize execution workflows to enhance trade execution strategies.”
Institutions also require data management tools to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.
A recent Deloitte poll shows that executives involved in managing digital assets expect risks to increase and the regulatory environment to become more complex this year.
Tim Davis, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and U.S. Blockchain Leader, believes, “Digital asset risk should be a mainstay board agenda item for any organization that actively uses digital assets in its operations.”
Given this, a Chainalysis spokesperson told Cryptonews that institutions could use Chainalysis on-chain data to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.
“For example, we can help clients understand how widely distributed an asset is, how liquid it is, what segments of the crypto economy are holding and using it, and whether those segments skew toward being illicit or risky,” the spokesperson said.
Since digital assets represent a fairly new sector for institutions, it is questionable if data management tools will be immediately implemented.
Yet Henderson noted that Amberdata expects institutions to use ARC moving forward.
“We have heard from many financial institutions and crypto native firms – both clients and not – that mapping assets across exchanges and markets is a major pain point across the trading life cycle,” she remarked.
Henderson added that Amberdata has already initiated the process of ARC integration for a few institutions. She further pointed out that because ARC is open-sourced, it will advance within the digital asset industry through community contributions and insights.
“There is a vast community of financial professionals and digital asset investors who will contribute to ARC, keep the dataset relevant and up to date, and eliminate proprietary biases on how to classify digital assets,” she said.
Yet challenges may arise. Sebastian Higgs, Chief Operating Officer and Co-founder of Cordial Systems – an institutional-grade self-custody software provider – told Cryptonews that while transparency benefits public blockchains, there is an extreme side for institutions who want to build products on blockchain infrastructure.
“They are still beholden to customer data privacy laws, confidentiality, and will want to retain certain processes or business logic as private instead of publishing them for the general public to see,” said Higgs.","May 17, 2024 14:08 EDT","","Rachel Wolfson",""

According to Nigerian media outlet Punch News, Judge Emeka Nwite ordered the crypto exchange’s Head of Compliance to stay in prison, citing his potential to jump bail if granted.
Gambaryan was originally detained alongside Binance’s Regional Manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, in late February before being charged with money laundering and tax evasion.
Anjarwalla later fled on foot and is still at large, despite earlier reports alleging that the Binance executive was recaptured in Kenya.

“I truly cannot believe my innocent husband is now – on his 40th birthday – having to face a trial for charges he has nothing to do with,” Tigran’s wife Yuki Gambaryan said in a statement originally published by DL News. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.”
Earlier this month, Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed the situation publicly for the first time in a blog post on the crypto exchange’s website. In it, he alleged that employees were originally approached by “unknown persons” in the African country who promised “to make these issues go away” should the crypto company accept a secret settlement.
According to the New York Times, the “settlement” was actually a $150 million bribe from a Nigerian government official.
“Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed,” Teng said, refusing the deal.
When the Binance executives were invited back for a series of policy talks under the assurance they would be granted “safe passage for their meetings,” the duo was detained.
The Nigerian government has since come out to deny Teng’s claims, saying they lack “any iota of substance.”
“It is nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfuscate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria,” a statement from Nigeria’s Ministry of Information and National Orientation said. “The facts of this matter remain that Binance is being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.”
Gambaryan’s formal arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22. It is unclear when or if Anjarwalla will be extradited to Nigeria should he be captured.","May 17, 2024 13:41 EDT","","Julia Smith",""

On May 16th, Reddit announced its partnership with OpenAI. This deal grants OpenAI access to Reddit’s data application programming interface (API), providing real-time content from platform posts.
https://x.com/Reddit/status/1791214691592610065
Reddit said this would “bring Reddit content to ChatGPT and new products.” Open AI COO Brad Lightcap said the venture will “explore the possibilities to enrich the Reddit experience with AI-powered features.”
The announcement also mentioned ChatGPT as the newest advertising partner of Reddit.
Following the announcement, Reddit saw a 5.45% decline, but in the pre-market, the site gained 13.78% to $64.15, as per Google Finance data.

Reddit has long been focused on finding ways to strengthen community engagement and develop revenue streams outside of offering advertising space.
OpenAI will give Reddit users and moderators a suite of new AI-powered features aimed at strengthening user engagement.
Using Reddit’s data API provides OpenAI with real-time, structured, and unique content from Reddit. AI tools can then apply this data to showcase more relevant Reddit content, especially on recent topics. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman commented:
“ChatGPT upholds our belief in a connected internet, helps people find more of what they’re looking for, and helps new audiences find community on Reddit.”
This partnership benefits OpenAI products by allowing access to Reddit’s API. Products like ChatGPT will gain up-to-date and relevant information, a previous limitation. Huffman added:
“Reddit has become one of the internet’s largest open archives of authentic, relevant, and always up-to-date human conversations about anything and everything.”
Reddit highlighted that this integration would not compromise privacy. Their Public Content Policy emphasizes user privacy and content protection.
The policy aims for complete transparency to “give communities, developers, and researchers a better sense of how Reddit thinks about access to public content and the protections that should exist for users.”
In recent years AI has seen significant adoption. AI cryptocurrencies rose an average of 257.2% in the first 2 months of 2024. This came with rising interest among major jurisdictions.
One of the leaders in this is the US. On May 15th, US senators proposed a $32 Billion Investment Plan to Boost AI development in the US over the next 3 years. This came to seize the opportunity to “harness the opportunities and address the risks” of the rapidly developing technology.
This development has given birth to a range of promising projects with real-world applications.
There have also been efforts to regulate AI. The European Union has again set a global precedent by unanimously passing The AI Act, legislation to govern AI.
The Act brings a targeted regulatory approach to some of the most pressing issues and anxieties around AI today. It crosses a crucial boundary, providing clarity and confidence.","May 17, 2024 08:45 EDT","","Harvey Hunter",""

In other crypto news today, ten public Bitcoin mining companies raised nearly $2 billion in gross proceeds from equity financing activities in the pre-halving Q1 2024, according to the latest Miner Weekly report by BlocksBridge Consulting. In comparison, these companies raised $1.25 billion in Q4, 2023.
Marathon, CleanSpark, and Riot, the largest companies per market cap, accounted for 73% of the funds these 10 companies raised. These three were holding $1.33 billion of cash and more than 32,200 BTC valued at over $2.2 billion as of March 31.
But the report notes that the financing activities “cooled down” in Q2.
“As of Wednesday, less than $500 million of investment was poured into subscribing major public mining stocks. That said, the number is already higher than Q3 last year,” the analysts said.
Furthermore, most of the public mining companies decided to hold onto their BTC holdings. They were holding more than 48,000 BTC combined as of April 30.
“While the proceeds from equity financing are generally used to fund hashrate and infrastructure expansion […], the abundance of cash reserves may also explain why most of the public mining companies chose to hold onto their bitcoin holdings.”

"https://cryptonews.com/news/donald-trump-crypto-friendly-stance-genuine-opportunistic.htm","https://cryptonews.com/","News Article","","Is Donald Trump’s Recent Crypto-Friendly Stance Genuine Or Opportunistic? Experts Weigh In","Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently expressed his backing for crypto, indicating that he would cease hostility towards crypto in the US if he were to be re-elected.
“If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be.” He also told the audience that if they like crypto, “you better vote for Trump.”
Previously, Trump openly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July 2019, he described them as “not money” and condemned their volatility and absence of intrinsic value. Additionally, he contended that these assets could facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking.
According to Coinbase, about 20% of American adults, or over 50m individuals, claim to hold crypto. Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, said that this substantial figure has undoubtedly captured the attention of the candidates.
“To embrace crypto and solid crypto regulation is a good election strategy and clever policy more generally,” he said. “Absolutely, a sizable number of people in the crypto community will vote for Trump based on his seemingly positive approach towards the industry.”
Meanwhile, Jonathan Thomas, CEO of prime brokerage Blueberry, asserted that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will influence voters prioritizing crypto as a single-issue matter.
“This is an aspect that some people hold dear to their hearts, and will vote for which candidate supports their bias,” he said. His crypto-friendly talk will resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but only if it doesn’t clash with other issues they care about even more, he added.
NFT enthusiast Thorne Melcher labeled Trump’s recent endorsement as “flimsy.” She noted it marks a significant departure from his previous negative remarks.
“Given crypto’s potential to facilitate the purchase of trans hormone replacement therapy, abortions, and drugs circumventing politics pushed by conservatives, it only feels like a matter of time before they involve it in their authoritarian crackdowns,” she said.
However, she noted that this doesn’t imply that Biden is favorable towards cryptocurrency. Yet, supporting Trump solely for the sake of crypto doesn’t seem to offer substantial benefits, and Trump himself is unlikely to gain much electoral support solely by endorsing it.
Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has now become a full-fledged NFT enthusiast. He actively participates in the market, even selling over $1m worth of NFTs, some featuring his mugshot.
According to Stephanie Vaughan, co-founder of DeFi protocol Veda, it’s evident that many individuals within the crypto community are inclined to support Trump or refrain from supporting Biden.
“I think that during the last election, there were probably a lot of crypto-focused voters who voted for Biden. Because, at that time, it wasn’t clear that he would take such a hardline approach against the industry,” she said.
“It’s clear now, however, that regulation by enforcement is the stance taken by the Biden Administration. And this is totally unworkable for a very large number of people who work in the industry or who are generally favorable towards it.”
She said that Trump acknowledges crypto’s emergence as a significant factor for a considerable portion of voters in the upcoming election. Consequently, he’s making concerted efforts to attract them away from Biden.","May 17, 2024 04:10 EDT","","Shalini Nagarajan",""

In an interview with 21st Century Business Herald, Wen Yang addressed the fragmentation in CBDC systems due to varying technological paths and standards among different economies, highlighting the organization’s effort to bridge technical gaps.
According to the report, over 130 economies are now exploring CBDCs, with nearly 70% of central banks expecting to issue them within the next decade. However, the rapid development could lead to potential “data silos” where systems are unable to communicate with one another.
“Currently, there are significant differences in the technological paths and standards, including protocols, among economies, which presents a ‘fragmentation’ challenge and leads to ‘data silos’,” said Yang.
“To date, 11 countries have fully launched their CBDCs, while others are in later stages of development,” said Yang.
China’s digital yuan has seen implementation across various applications, while the European Central Bank is in the process of preparing for a digital Euro. In India, commercial banks handle one million digital rupee transactions daily across the country.
Swift launched the second phase of its CBDC sandbox in July 2023, focusing on complex use cases in digital trade, digital assets, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.
“The project lasted six months and involved 38 financial institutions from around the world, including regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures, involving applications of seven different CBDCs,” said Yang.
Yang also emphasized the importance of interoperability in cross-border CBDC use. The sandbox results reaffirmed SWIFT’s proposal to simplify digital transactions while allowing financial institutions to continue utilizing their existing infrastructures.
“Tests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts have proven technically feasible for automating trade payments,” stated Yang.
He indicated that Swift plans to expand its CBDC connector solution to test more extensive use cases in a comprehensive environment. This would include enhancing support for on-chain forex settlements and cross-border payments, addressing growing market demands.","May 17, 2024 03:37 EDT","","Hongji Feng",""

The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot, focused on establishing a standardized method for providing net asset value (NAV) data of funds on blockchains.
Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) played a key role in achieving this goal.
According to the DTCC’s report, the program demonstrated that structured data could be delivered on-chain, paving the way for various on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.
The successful outcomes of the pilot program have implications for future industry exploration and enablement of numerous downstream use cases.
These include brokerage applications, more automated data dissemination, and easier access to historical data for funds.
The DTCC’s report noted that the program facilitated better-automated data management, minimal disruption to existing market practices in traditional financial institutions, retrieval of historical data without manual record-keeping, and broader API solutions for price data.
Prominent US banking firms actively participated in the pilot program, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.
Following the release of the DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value.
Over the past 12 months, LINK has demonstrated significant growth, gaining more than 130% amid the broader uptick in the cryptocurrency market.
The DTCC’s report coincides with the growing enthusiasm among major traditional financial institutions for real-world asset tokenization.
On March 19, BlackRock, a leading investment management firm, introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum network.
The fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in assets such as U.S. Treasury bills.
Operating as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL, the fund is often referred to as the “digital liquidity fund” due to its digitized nature on the Ethereum blockchain.
As reported, the TVL for RWA protocols soared to nearly $8 billion by the end of April.
Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users.
Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth.
Tokenized treasuries have also seen remarkable expansion as yields remain high in an environment of elevated inflation and interest rates in the United States.
The RWA.xyz platform reported a record $1.29 billion locked-in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, representing an 80% surge since the beginning of 2024.
Back in March, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced that it has made a foray into the digital asset realm with the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.","May 17, 2024 02:49 EDT","","Ruholamin Haqshanas",""

Per Newsis, police seized 90,000 doses of drugs including methamphetamine (crystal meth), synthetic marijuana, and ketamine.
Officers said the ring used Vietnam-based smugglers to hide the drugs in cosmetics products.
Gang members then allegedly sent these products to South Korea via international courier services.
Police said they had remanded nine people in custody, including two suspected South Korean ringleaders (both aged 36).
Officers added that they had charged 25 other people with related crimes. Police say the ring was active from August 2023 to April this year.
A police spokesperson added that the ring sold the narcotics online to crypto-paying buyers. The group reportedly made use of Telegram as a communications tool.
Recent reports have claimed that Korean-language Telegram channels have become a “department store” for drug buyers and dealers.
Chungbuk Police Agency said its criminal task force’s drug crime investigation unit carried out the raids.
A police spokesperson explained that the suspected masterminds hid the drugs they received in a “hole in a mountainside.”
When police investigated this hiding place, they found almost six lite
