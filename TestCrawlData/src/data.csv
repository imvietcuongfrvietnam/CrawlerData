The legislation, known as OKHB3594, was signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt and sponsored by four Republicans: State Senators Bill Coleman and Dana Prieto and State Representatives Brian Hill and Cody Maynard.
The bill prohibits any restrictions or bans on using self-custody or hardware wallets to store digital assets, which ensures that individuals in Oklahoma have the freedom to control and safeguard their own digital assets without interference from third parties.
The legislation also allows Oklahomans to engage in both home-based and industrial crypto mining as long as they comply with local noise ordinances.
The digital asset self-custody bill will go into effect on November 1, 2024.
One notable provision of the bill is the exemption of crypto miners from obtaining a money transmitter license.

This means that individuals involved in home digital asset mining or running digital asset mining businesses, as well as those engaged in staking or staking as a service, are not required to acquire a license typically associated with financial transactions.
Additionally, the bill outlaws discriminatory electricity rates for digital asset mining businesses, ensuring fair treatment in terms of energy costs.
The legislation also addresses the use of digital assets as a payment method.
Oklahoma residents can utilize cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services without being subjected to additional taxes, withholdings, assessments, or charges imposed solely because of the use of digital assets in transactions.
Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, emphasized the bill’s importance in protecting fundamental Bitcoin rights.
“Without the ability to manage our wealth, we lose control of our destiny and the chance to create better futures for our families,” he wrote in a post on X. “This law ensures that everyone can secure not only their [bitcoin] but all their assets.”

Countries worldwide are increasingly considering confiscating crypto assets for debt collection from taxpayers.
South Korean tax officials in the city of Pohang revealed plans to seize crypto from 5,208 residents who failed to pay local taxes.
Per local reports, the individuals have all evaded local tax bills worth $370 or above.
The drive saw tax officials seize almost $29 million in coins and fiat in 2023.
Likewise, the Spanish Ministry of Finance wants to enable the seizure of digital assets to settle tax debts.
Under the leadership of María Jesús Montero, the ministry is currently working on legislative reforms to the General Tax Law.
The proposed changes would grant the Spanish Tax Agency the authority to identify and control crypto assets owned by taxpayers with outstanding debts.","May 17, 2024 16:54 EDT","","Ruholamin Haqshanas","Cryptonews Blockchain News Oklahoma Enacts Bill Safeguarding Residents’ Right to Self-Custody Digital Assets Ruholamin Haqshanas      known as OKHB3594 crypto miners #BTC #digitalassets #crypto https://t.co/lhdcymffZj pic.twitter.com/eDDlOqntog May 16, 2024 he wrote in a post on X #Bitcoin #Bitcoin #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/KdPsmLBzDo May 14, 2024 revealed plans to seize crypto saw tax officials seize almost $29 million wants to enable the seizure of digital assets Follow Us on Google News Crypto Regulation"

In a character reference for the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO, Trabucco described Salame as an “affable” and “complex” person who “doesn’t deserve to be defined by his worst actions.”
“Simply put, Ryan is my best friend. He has also committed crimes,” Trabucco wrote. “He’s acknowledged that and is prepared to accept the consequences.”
Trabucco further said that he had hoped Salame would receive a “fair” sentence in relation to the digital asset scandal, referring to him as a “sought-after employee in the crypto space.”

Salame, who recently requested a sentencing length of eighteen months in prison, pled guilty to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting license and conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions back in September 2023.
Salame has largely distanced himself from the doomed crypto exchange, with lawyers for the FTX executive arguing that he had limited knowledge of the company’s $8 billion fraud scheme.
“As was true for thousands of other FTX employees, customers, investors, and lenders, Ryan lost years of hard work and nearly his entire net worth almost instantaneously,” the court filing read. “Ryan, who was not part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s innermost circle, was unaware of the crimes at the center of this case.”
Salame’s unlawful political contributions charge stems from over 300 secret donations totaling tens of millions of dollars made by Bankman-Fried, with the willing participation of the former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO and the company’s Head of Engineering, Nishad Singh.
Prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried, who is currently serving 25 years in prison for orchestrating the fraud scheme, used the straw donor scheme to levy influence and power to pro-crypto politicians.
Of course, these donations were largely funded by FTX customers’ money, which Bankman-Fried stole and used to fund venture investments, real estate purchases, and more while claiming investors’ funds were safe.
“He built a pyramid of deceit on a foundation of lies and false promises,” U.S. prosecutors claimed during SBF’s trial. “And when it collapsed, it left a trail of destruction in its wake.”
Salame’s sentencing will take place at Manhattan federal court on May 28 at 11 a.m. He is facing a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.","May 17, 2024 16:40 EDT","","Julia Smith","Cryptonews Blockchain News Former Alameda Research CEO Sam Trabucco Defends FTX Exec Ryan Salame Ahead Of Sentencing Julia Smith      character reference https://t.co/oQqJ2Rppqf May 15, 2024 sentencing length of eighteen months in prison crypto exchange who is currently serving 25 years in prison largely funded by FTX customers’ money Follow Us on Google News FTX Sam Bankman-Fried"
"https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-launches-e-cny-wallets-for-payments.htm","https://cryptonews.com/","News Article","","Hong Kong Launches Personal e-CNY Wallets For Cross-Border Payments","Hong Kong became the first region outside mainland China to allow users to open digital wallets and hold China’s CBDC e-CNY, otherwise known as the digital yuan on Friday.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s central bank, announced that permanent residents and foreign nationals living in Hong Kong can now open e-CNY wallets using their local mobile phone numbers with four major mainland Chinese state-owned banks.
The accredited banks licensed to facilitate the CBDC wallet opening are the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Construction Bank, and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.
HKMA and People’s Bank of China have expanded the scope of the e-CNY pilot in Hong Kong.

“Unlike conventional digital wallets, the e-CNY wallet has the full endorsement of the People’s Bank of China,”Howard Lee, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Deputy Chief Executive, emphasize.
He added that the key objective of the digital yuan is to provide Hong Kong residents with a “safe and convenient option for cross-border payments” when traveling to the Greater Bay Area integration zone, which comprises Hong Kong, Macao, and nine cities in Guangdong province.
Recall that Crypto News reported in January 2024 that the Chinese central bank plans to expand the digital yuan to Hong Kong to foster cross-border payment.
Hong Kong’s retailers are concerned, however. They believe there is more demand for mobile payment in mainland cities like Shenzhen, where shopping and dining are predominant, which could divert consumption away from the city.
Currently, around 300 merchants in Hong Kong accept e-CNY payments, subject to certain limits. Individual wallet balances are capped at ¥10,000 ($1,380), and single transactions are limited to ¥2,000, while annual spending is restricted to ¥50,000.
HK residents can top up their wallets via Hong Kong’s Faster Payment System (FPS), which has been integrated with the e-CNY payment infrastructure.
Senior economist at Natixis Hong Kong Gary Ng described the development as “a big move compared to the past” in promoting the yuan’s internationalization. He expects more companies to adopt the system going forward.
According to the latest figures released by the People’s Bank of China, domestic transactions facilitated by the digital yuan reached a staggering 1.8 trillion yuan (approximately $249 billion) as of the end of June 2023. The surge in usage has been driven by the opening of over 120 million individual e-CNY digital wallets nationwide, with over 29 million digital yuan wallets opened in Suzhou.
Despite these growths, many workers actively convert their e-CNY into fiat currency, indicating a clear preference for physical cash. As CryptoNews reported, Chinese workers are hesitant to use CBDC due to its perceived lack of utility and privacy concerns.","May 17, 2024 16:33 EDT","","Jimmy Aki","Cryptonews Blockchain News Hong Kong Launches Personal e-CNY Wallets For Cross-Border Payments Jimmy Aki      The Hong Kong Monetary Authority pic.twitter.com/SF5GxJXp8H May 17, 2024 expand the digital yuan to Hong Kong concerned Senior economist at Natixis Hong Kong Gary Ng the latest figures released over 29 million digital yuan wallets opened in Suzhou Chinese workers are hesitant to use CBDC due to its perceived lack of utility Follow Us on Google News Digital Yuan e-CNY Wallet"

As of the end of Q1, more than 900 institutions based in the United States had disclosed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shareholdings exceeding $100 million, equating to $10.7 billion combined.
In addition, leading asset management firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have launched tokenized treasury funds. Recent data indicates that more than $1 billion in treasury notes has been tokenized on public blockchain networks.
A bi-annual survey conducted by KPMG in Canada further found that institutional investors located in the region greatly increased their crypto holdings in 2023. According to KPMG’s survey, 22% more financial services organizations offered crypto asset products and services to clients last year than in previous years.

While notable, digital asset data is still a challenge for institutions.
Isabella Henderson, Director of Product Strategy at Amberdata, told Cryptonews that digital asset data is dense and complex.
“Each crypto exchange uses different tickers and hundreds of thousands of asset instruments,” said Henderson. “This makes consistency and reliability a challenge for institutions.”
Henderson pointed out that in traditional finance, standardized security masters and asset references solve these challenges by aligning front, middle, and back offices.
Yet she noted that the digital asset space lacks such solutions, resulting in a fragmented view of the crypto sector for institutions.
To solve this problem, Amerberdata recently launched an asset reference and classification tool. Known as “ARC,” this is an institutional-grade security master database for digital assets.
A security master database is a data store that contains reference data about financial products. Such a tool is used by market participants to organize their records across trading, risk, clearing, and settlement operations.

— Amberdata (@Amberdataio) May 16, 2024

Henderson explained that ARC is an open-source dataset that enables financial institutions to segment and view the digital asset sector consistently.
“By combining reference details, classification, and categorization, ARC is a solution that provides transparency into the operations and use cases of any digital asset,” she remarked.
Henderson elaborated that ARC unifies front, middle, and back offices for institutions holding digital assets. This is done through data collected by Amberdata, which tracks traded crypto pairs across over 150,000 spot, options, and futures instruments.
“ARC shows token addresses, contract and trade specifications, price limits, exploits, and more,” said Henderson. “ARC IDs also map an asset’s associated instruments across the digital asset ecosystem, using a tagging classification system to flexibly classify industries and proper use cases.”
Henderson believes that such a tool can help institutions with analysis and reference, trading, and for other instances.
“For example, ARC will help institutions keep records of the highly dynamic universe of digital assets with a repository of accurate asset and classification information for reference and analysis,” she said. “It can also optimize execution workflows to enhance trade execution strategies.”
Institutions also require data management tools to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.
A recent Deloitte poll shows that executives involved in managing digital assets expect risks to increase and the regulatory environment to become more complex this year.
Tim Davis, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and U.S. Blockchain Leader, believes, “Digital asset risk should be a mainstay board agenda item for any organization that actively uses digital assets in its operations.”
Given this, a Chainalysis spokesperson told Cryptonews that institutions could use Chainalysis on-chain data to evaluate risks associated with digital assets.
“For example, we can help clients understand how widely distributed an asset is, how liquid it is, what segments of the crypto economy are holding and using it, and whether those segments skew toward being illicit or risky,” the spokesperson said.
Since digital assets represent a fairly new sector for institutions, it is questionable if data management tools will be immediately implemented.
Yet Henderson noted that Amberdata expects institutions to use ARC moving forward.
“We have heard from many financial institutions and crypto native firms – both clients and not – that mapping assets across exchanges and markets is a major pain point across the trading life cycle,” she remarked.
Henderson added that Amberdata has already initiated the process of ARC integration for a few institutions. She further pointed out that because ARC is open-sourced, it will advance within the digital asset industry through community contributions and insights.
“There is a vast community of financial professionals and digital asset investors who will contribute to ARC, keep the dataset relevant and up to date, and eliminate proprietary biases on how to classify digital assets,” she said.
Yet challenges may arise. Sebastian Higgs, Chief Operating Officer and Co-founder of Cordial Systems – an institutional-grade self-custody software provider – told Cryptonews that while transparency benefits public blockchains, there is an extreme side for institutions who want to build products on blockchain infrastructure.
“They are still beholden to customer data privacy laws, confidentiality, and will want to retain certain processes or business logic as private instead of publishing them for the general public to see,” said Higgs.","May 17, 2024 14:08 EDT","","Rachel Wolfson","Cryptonews Blockchain News Institutions Will Require Data Management Tools For Digital Asset Adoption Rachel Wolfson      BlackRock and Franklin Templeton indicates KPMG in Canada further found pic.twitter.com/hwoLkTKYnw May 16, 2024 digital asset data an asset reference and classification tool pic.twitter.com/sfyD3t7PuZ May 16, 2024 risks associated with digital assets Deloitte poll shows Chainalysis on-chain data Follow Us on Google News data Digital Assets"

According to Nigerian media outlet Punch News, Judge Emeka Nwite ordered the crypto exchange’s Head of Compliance to stay in prison, citing his potential to jump bail if granted.
Gambaryan was originally detained alongside Binance’s Regional Manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, in late February before being charged with money laundering and tax evasion.
Anjarwalla later fled on foot and is still at large, despite earlier reports alleging that the Binance executive was recaptured in Kenya.
On this very unhappy birthday, a reminder that @TigranGambaryan has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government…
— Noah Perlman (@NoahBPerlman) May 17, 2024

“I truly cannot believe my innocent husband is now – on his 40th birthday – having to face a trial for charges he has nothing to do with,” Tigran’s wife Yuki Gambaryan said in a statement originally published by DL News. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.”
Earlier this month, Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed the situation publicly for the first time in a blog post on the crypto exchange’s website. In it, he alleged that employees were originally approached by “unknown persons” in the African country who promised “to make these issues go away” should the crypto company accept a secret settlement.
According to the New York Times, the “settlement” was actually a $150 million bribe from a Nigerian government official.
“Our team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed,” Teng said, refusing the deal.
When the Binance executives were invited back for a series of policy talks under the assurance they would be granted “safe passage for their meetings,” the duo was detained.
The Nigerian government has since come out to deny Teng’s claims, saying they lack “any iota of substance.”
“It is nothing but a diversionary tactic and an attempted act of blackmail by a company desperate to obfuscate the grievous criminal charges it is facing in Nigeria,” a statement from Nigeria’s Ministry of Information and National Orientation said. “The facts of this matter remain that Binance is being investigated in Nigeria for allowing its platform to be used for money laundering, terrorism financing, and foreign exchange manipulation through illegal trading.”
Gambaryan’s formal arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22.

On May 16th, Reddit announced its partnership with OpenAI. This deal grants OpenAI access to Reddit’s data application programming interface (API), providing real-time content from platform posts.
https://x.com/Reddit/status/1791214691592610065
Reddit said this would “bring Reddit content to ChatGPT and new products.” Open AI COO Brad Lightcap said the venture will “explore the possibilities to enrich the Reddit experience with AI-powered features.”
The announcement also mentioned ChatGPT as the newest advertising partner of Reddit.
Following the announcement, Reddit saw a 5.45% decline, but in the pre-market, the site gained 13.78% to $64.15, as per Google Finance data.

Reddit has long been focused on finding ways to strengthen community engagement and develop revenue streams outside of offering advertising space.
OpenAI will give Reddit users and moderators a suite of new AI-powered features aimed at strengthening user engagement.
Using Reddit’s data API provides OpenAI with real-time, structured, and unique content from Reddit. AI tools can then apply this data to showcase more relevant Reddit content, especially on recent topics. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman commented:
“ChatGPT upholds our belief in a connected internet, helps people find more of what they’re looking for, and helps new audiences find community on Reddit.”
This partnership benefits OpenAI products by allowing access to Reddit’s API. Products like ChatGPT will gain up-to-date and relevant information, a previous limitation. Huffman added:
“Reddit has become one of the internet’s largest open archives of authentic, relevant, and always up-to-date human conversations about anything and everything.”
Reddit highlighted that this integration would not compromise privacy. Their Public Content Policy emphasizes user privacy and content protection.
The policy aims for complete transparency to “give communities, developers, and researchers a better sense of how Reddit thinks about access to public content and the protections that should exist for users.”
In recent years AI has seen significant adoption. AI cryptocurrencies rose an average of 257.2% in the first 2 months of 2024. This came with rising interest among major jurisdictions.
One of the leaders in this is the US. On May 15th, US senators proposed a $32 Billion Investment Plan to Boost AI development in the US over the next 3 years. This came to seize the opportunity to “harness the opportunities and address the risks” of the rapidly developing technology.
This development has given birth to a range of promising projects with real-world applications.
There have also been efforts to regulate AI. The European Union has again set a global precedent by unanimously passing The AI Act, legislation to govern AI.
The Act brings a targeted regulatory approach to some of the most pressing issues and anxieties around AI today. It crosses a crucial boundary, providing clarity and confidence.","May 17, 2024 08:45 EDT","","Harvey Hunter","Cryptonews Blockchain News Reddit Shares Jump After OpenAI Data-Sharing Deal Harvey Hunter      announced data rising interest $32 Billion Investment Plan to Boost AI development in the US over the next 3 years promising projects passing The AI Act Follow Us on Google News AI"

Digital payments platform SKUx announced it has signed an agreement with the payments giant Visa.
Per the press release, the agreement will accelerate digital transformation for select merchants and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies that leverage SKUx’s payment-based offer solutions.
Furthermore, it will enable Visa clients to engage directly with SKUx. This will drive value creation among B2B and B2C payment flows for merchants and manufacturers.
Also, it will help merchants drive customer acquisition, digitize customer care and recovery, and target product-level spend.
“Together, our interconnected solutions drive client and customer value upstream to deliver a low friction, more personalized commerce experience,” the press release said.
Meanwhile, SKUx says that, via its multi-patented digital payments platform, it is advancing the outdated physical to digital process of checks, coupons, rebates, and promotional offers.
This is solving long-term industry challenges for merchants, consumer brands, loyalty platforms, travel companies, healthcare providers, and others, it said. Already, several “leading CPG brands” leverage the SKUx platform.
“Benchmarked results have seen up to 85% reductions in paper checks, with digital delivery of customer payments provided in near real-time as opposed to days or weeks with physical offers, dramatically reducing costs, effort, and fraud,” it added.
In other crypto news today, ten public Bitcoin mining companies raised nearly $2 billion in gross proceeds from equity financing activities in the pre-halving Q1 2024, according to the latest Miner Weekly report by BlocksBridge Consulting. In comparison, these companies raised $1.25 billion in Q4, 2023.
Marathon, CleanSpark, and Riot, the largest companies per market cap, accounted for 73% of the funds these 10 companies raised. These three were holding $1.33 billion of cash and more than 32,200 BTC valued at over $2.2 billion as of March 31.
But the report notes that the financing activities “cooled down” in Q2.
“As of Wednesday, less than $500 million of investment was poured into subscribing major public mining stocks. That said, the number is already higher than Q3 last year,” the analysts said.
Furthermore, most of the public mining companies decided to hold onto their BTC holdings. They were holding more than 48,000 BTC combined as of April 30.
“While the proceeds from equity financing are generally used to fund hashrate and infrastructure expansion […], the abundance of cash reserves may also explain why most of the public mining companies chose to hold onto their bitcoin holdings.”

"https://cryptonews.com/news/donald-trump-crypto-friendly-stance-genuine-opportunistic.htm","https://cryptonews.com/","News Article","","Is Donald Trump’s Recent Crypto-Friendly Stance Genuine Or Opportunistic? Experts Weigh In","Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently expressed his backing for crypto, indicating that he would cease hostility towards crypto in the US if he were to be re-elected.
“If we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be.” He also told the audience that if they like crypto, “you better vote for Trump.”
Previously, Trump openly criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In July 2019, he described them as “not money” and condemned their volatility and absence of intrinsic value. Additionally, he contended that these assets could facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking.
According to Coinbase, about 20% of American adults, or over 50m individuals, claim to hold crypto. Markus Levin, co-founder of XYO Network, said that this substantial figure has undoubtedly captured the attention of the candidates.
“To embrace crypto and solid crypto regulation is a good election strategy and clever policy more generally,” he said. “Absolutely, a sizable number of people in the crypto community will vote for Trump based on his seemingly positive approach towards the industry.”
Meanwhile, Jonathan Thomas, CEO of prime brokerage Blueberry, asserted that Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will influence voters prioritizing crypto as a single-issue matter.
“This is an aspect that some people hold dear to their hearts, and will vote for which candidate supports their bias,” he said. His crypto-friendly talk will resonate with crypto enthusiasts, but only if it doesn’t clash with other issues they care about even more, he added.
NFT enthusiast Thorne Melcher labeled Trump’s recent endorsement as “flimsy.” She noted it marks a significant departure from his previous negative remarks.
“Given crypto’s potential to facilitate the purchase of trans hormone replacement therapy, abortions, and drugs circumventing politics pushed by conservatives, it only feels like a matter of time before they involve it in their authoritarian crackdowns,” she said.
However, she noted that this doesn’t imply that Biden is favorable towards cryptocurrency. Yet, supporting Trump solely for the sake of crypto doesn’t seem to offer substantial benefits, and Trump himself is unlikely to gain much electoral support solely by endorsing it.
Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has now become a full-fledged NFT enthusiast. He actively participates in the market, even selling over $1m worth of NFTs, some featuring his mugshot.
According to Stephanie Vaughan, co-founder of DeFi protocol Veda, it’s evident that many individuals within the crypto community are inclined to support Trump or refrain from supporting Biden.
“I think that during the last election, there were probably a lot of crypto-focused voters who voted for Biden. Because, at that time, it wasn’t clear that he would take such a hardline approach against the industry,” she said.
“It’s clear now, however, that regulation by enforcement is the stance taken by the Biden Administration. And this is totally unworkable for a very large number of people who work in the industry or who are generally favorable towards it.”
She said that Trump acknowledges crypto’s emergence as a significant factor for a considerable portion of voters in the upcoming election. Consequently, he’s making concerted efforts to attract them away from Biden.","May 17, 2024 04:10 EDT","","Shalini Nagarajan","Cryptonews Blockchain News Is Donald Trump’s Recent Crypto-Friendly Stance Genuine Or Opportunistic?

In an interview with 21st Century Business Herald, Wen Yang addressed the fragmentation in CBDC systems due to varying technological paths and standards among different economies, highlighting the organization’s effort to bridge technical gaps.
According to the report, over 130 economies are now exploring CBDCs, with nearly 70% of central banks expecting to issue them within the next decade. However, the rapid development could lead to potential “data silos” where systems are unable to communicate with one another.
“Currently, there are significant differences in the technological paths and standards, including protocols, among economies, which presents a ‘fragmentation’ challenge and leads to ‘data silos’,” said Yang.
“To date, 11 countries have fully launched their CBDCs, while others are in later stages of development,” said Yang.
China’s digital yuan has seen implementation across various applications, while the European Central Bank is in the process of preparing for a digital Euro. In India, commercial banks handle one million digital rupee transactions daily across the country.
Swift launched the second phase of its CBDC sandbox in July 2023, focusing on complex use cases in digital trade, digital assets, and foreign exchange networks for CBDC payments and settlements.
“The project lasted six months and involved 38 financial institutions from around the world, including regulators, commercial banks, and market infrastructures, involving applications of seven different CBDCs,” said Yang.
Yang also emphasized the importance of interoperability in cross-border CBDC use. The sandbox results reaffirmed SWIFT’s proposal to simplify digital transactions while allowing financial institutions to continue utilizing their existing infrastructures.
“Tests on the interaction between digital trade platforms and CBDC networks using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts have proven technically feasible for automating trade payments,” stated Yang.
He indicated that Swift plans to expand its CBDC connector solution to test more extensive use cases in a comprehensive environment. This would include enhancing support for on-chain forex settlements and cross-border payments, addressing growing market demands.","May 17, 2024 03:37 EDT","","Hongji Feng","Cryptonews Blockchain News SWIFT China President Wen Yang on Overcoming Barriers in CBDC Systems Hongji Feng      SWIFT interview with 21st Century Business Herald digital yuan digital Euro India Follow Us on Google News CBDC"

The primary objective of the program was to enhance the tokenization of traditional finance funds.
The pilot program, known as the Smart NAV Pilot, focused on establishing a standardized method for providing net asset value (NAV) data of funds on blockchains.
Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) played a key role in achieving this goal.
According to the DTCC’s report, the program demonstrated that structured data could be delivered on-chain, paving the way for various on-chain use cases such as tokenized funds and “bulk consumer” smart contracts, which hold data for multiple funds.
The successful outcomes of the pilot program have implications for future industry exploration and enablement of numerous downstream use cases.
These include brokerage applications, more automated data dissemination, and easier access to historical data for funds.
The DTCC’s report noted that the program facilitated better-automated data management, minimal disruption to existing market practices in traditional financial institutions, retrieval of historical data without manual record-keeping, and broader API solutions for price data.
Prominent US banking firms actively participated in the pilot program, including American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.
Following the release of the DTCC’s report, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, experienced a 12.5% increase in value.
Over the past 12 months, LINK has demonstrated significant growth, gaining more than 130% amid the broader uptick in the cryptocurrency market.
The DTCC’s report coincides with the growing enthusiasm among major traditional financial institutions for real-world asset tokenization.
On March 19, BlackRock, a leading investment management firm, introduced a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum network.
The fund allows investors to acquire tokens representing shares in the fund, which primarily invests in assets such as U.S. Treasury bills.
Operating as an ERC-20 token called BUIDL, the fund is often referred to as the “digital liquidity fund” due to its digitized nature on the Ethereum blockchain.
As reported, the TVL for RWA protocols soared to nearly $8 billion by the end of April.
Some protocols have played a significant role in driving this growth, particularly in terms of active users.
Digital carbon market platforms like Toucan and KlimaDAO, as well as the real estate tokenization protocol Propy, have experienced substantial user growth.
Tokenized treasuries have also seen remarkable expansion as yields remain high in an environment of elevated inflation and interest rates in the United States.
The RWA.xyz platform reported a record $1.29 billion locked-in tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds, representing an 80% surge since the beginning of 2024.
Back in March, DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, also announced that it has made a foray into the digital asset realm with the launch of its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens.","May 17, 2024 02:49 EDT","","Ruholamin Haqshanas","Cryptonews Blockchain News DTCC and Chainlink Launch Pilot Program with US Banking Giants to Advance Tokenization in TradFi Ruholamin Haqshanas      DTCC’s report tokenized money market fund called BUIDL soared to nearly $8 billion tokenized U.S. treasuries and bonds announced that it has made a foray Follow Us on Google News ChainLink"

Per Newsis, police seized 90,000 doses of drugs including methamphetamine (crystal meth), synthetic marijuana, and ketamine.
Officers said the ring used Vietnam-based smugglers to hide the drugs in cosmetics products.
Gang members then allegedly sent these products to South Korea via international courier services.
Police said they had remanded nine people in custody, including two suspected South Korean ringleaders (both aged 36).
Officers added that they had charged 25 other people with related crimes. Police say the ring was active from August 2023 to April this year.
A police spokesperson added that the ring sold the narcotics online to crypto-paying buyers. The group reportedly made use of Telegram as a communications tool.
Recent reports have claimed that Korean-language Telegram channels have become a “department store” for drug buyers and dealers.
Chungbuk Police Agency said its criminal task force’s drug crime investigation unit carried out the raids.
A police spokesperson explained that the suspected masterminds hid the drugs they received in a “hole in a mountainside.”
When police investigated this hiding place, they found almost six liters of synthetic marijuana solution.
This haul alone is “worth over $1 million” on the domestic market, officers told reporters.

Investigators also found 181g of methamphetamine and 31g of ketamine, all “buried under the ground in the countryside.”
Officers said that gang members would periodically come to the hiding place to divide the synthetic marijuana “into 10ml units (vials).”
They would then “sell these through social media channels such as Telegram.” In each case, recipients would “pay in cryptocurrency,” police said.
Police released photographs of lipstick and other cosmetics containers. They explained that the gang hid drugs inside these containers before sending them from Vietnam.
Officers said they had also seized funds worth over $245,000. They added that the investigation is ongoing.
The spokesperson said police suspect that “other people” may be involved, “including overseas suppliers.”
Park Ji-hwan, the unit’s head, said all the cases had been handed over to the prosecution service.
The police chief also called on the public to “report any suspected instances” of crypto-powered drug crime “to the investigative agencies.”

According to Thursday’s announcement, the partnership will enhance the user experience for transactions with its digital assets, USDT and Tether Gold (XAUt), on The Open Network (TON). By incorporating the Oobit mobile payment app, Tether will provide merchants with a more seamless and convenient way to handle cryptocurrency payments.
Oobit’s Tap & Pay feature allows merchants to receive fiat currency even if the payment is in USDT. The integration is set to expand the practical use of cryptocurrencies, making them a widely accepted payment option.
Earlier in February, Tether participated in Oobit’s Series A funding round, which raised $25 million. Oobit CEO Amram Adar highlighted the inclusive nature of the partnership.
“We’re not just providing another payment option; we’re providing unbanked access to the most prominent cryptocurrencies and worldwide payments using Oobit,” Adar said.
The TON blockchain, integrated with Telegram, facilitates a simple, borderless experience for peer-to-peer payments. This, in turn, leads to a higher percentage of the population having access to decentralized services and an improved user experience.
Since the integration, over $200 million worth of USDT has been issued on TON‘s blockchain, enabling users to send USDT via direct messages on Telegram and utilize it for instant crypto Tap payments on Oobit.
USDT is also available on 14 other blockchains, including Tron and Ethereum, and joined the Celo network in March.
Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration.
“Together, we will provide banking solutions to the unbanked population and revolutionize how users transact with cryptocurrencies, making it easier and more convenient,” said Ardoino.
Earlier this month, Tether officially announced additional investment into CityPay.io, a platform enabling users to make payments at various establishments, including Wendy’s and Radisson Hotels, using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It also plans to expand to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.","May 16, 2024 17:01 EDT","","Hassan Shittu","Cryptonews Blockchain News Tether and TON Partner with Oobit for USDT-to-Fiat Transactions via Mobile App Hassan Shittu      Tether launched USDT and XAUt @ton_blockchain @oobit https://t.co/Qaf6gTPhK9 pic.twitter.com/A9A3P6L5He May 16, 2024 Thursday’s announcement in Oobit’s Series A funding round USDT has been issued on TON the Celo network in March additional investment into CityPay.io Follow Us on Google News Oobit Tether USDT"

Commenting on the program, Kulipa founder Axel Cateland expressed optimism about unlocking mass crypto adoption and promoting wider financial inclusion through convenient global stablecoin payments.
In a recent announcement, Mastercard and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) have completed the first live test of Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). The proof-of-concept pilot involved tokenizing carbon credits within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, showcasing a novel blockchain application in financial services.
In the pilot, a client of SCBHK’s virtual bank, Mox Bank, initiated the process by depositing funds into Mox and requesting a carbon credit.
Subsequently, Mox directed SCBHK to tokenize the carbon credit through Libeara, a tokenization service provider developed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm, SC Ventures. The MTN tokenized the deposit, and an atomic swap—a real-time exchange occurring across different blockchains—was executed to swap the tokens.
Mastercard launched the MTN in June 2023 using its private blockchain infrastructure. Previous trial runs of the MTN included collaborations with the Reserve Bank of Australia using wrapped central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the HKMA’s e-HKD CBDC.
Although these CBDCs are not yet live, the trials demonstrated the potential for such technologies in modernizing financial transactions.","May 16, 2024 16:06 EDT","","Hassan Shittu","Cryptonews Blockchain News Mastercard’s Start Path Welcomes Five Startups to Develop Blockchain Use Cases Hassan Shittu      Mastercard’s new initiative #MastercardProgramm @Mastercard pic.twitter.com/oMAFWTQUUf May 15, 2024 @Mastercard pic.twitter.com/bp9Z1Nps8x May 15, 2024 In a recent announcement collaborations with the Reserve Bank of Australia Although these CBDCs are not yet live Follow Us on Google News Blockchain"

SEBI’s proposition signals a willingness to embrace private virtual assets – an approach previously not seen in India.
The RBI sees private digital currencies as a potential macroeconomic risk, however.
As per the Reuters report, these suggestions were made to a “government panel” tasked with formulating policy for the finance ministry to consider.
SEBI recommended that various regulators oversee cryptocurrency-related activities falling under their domain in its proposition. Additionally, it suggested avoiding a single unified regulator for digital assets.
SEBI stated it could monitor cryptocurrencies categorized as securities and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). SEBI could also issue licenses for equity market-related products.
#SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) is open to the oversight of #crypto trade, in contrast to #RBI (Reserve Bank of India).

This would be similar to the US, where securities and crypto exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) should regulate virtual assets related to insurance and pensions, according to the proposal.
It also recommended that the grievances of investors trading in cryptocurrencies should be resolved under India’s Consumer Protection Act.
Since 2018, India has adopted a tough stance on cryptocurrencies. The RBI prohibited lenders and financial intermediaries from dealing with crypto users or exchanges. The Supreme Court later struck down this move, however.
In 2021, the government prepared a bill that would have banned cryptocurrencies, though it has not been introduced.
In 2023, when it was president of the G20, the country called for a global framework to regulate such assets.
The RBI is still in favor of a ban on stablecoins, believing that digital currencies represent a macroeconomic risk.
The Hindu reported that RBI Deputy Governor T. Rabi Sankar believes that stablecoins, particularly those linked to economies like the US and Europe, can be risky.
“We have to be very careful about allowing these sorts of instruments… From the past experience in other countries, it is an existential threat to policy sovereignty,” he said
The RBI further highlighted concerns about cryptocurrencies, citing risks like tax evasion and peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized activities relying on voluntary compliance.
It also expressed worry about losing “seigniorage,” income from money creation.
After the Supreme Court overturned its 2018 orders, the RBI urged strict compliance with regulations, excluding cryptocurrencies from India’s financial system.
Despite this, cryptocurrency trade continued, prompting the government to introduce a crypto tax in 2022. Later, all exchanges were mandated to register locally to facilitate crypto transactions.
Although there is no public announcement, Routers added that the panel could submit its report by June.","May 16, 2024 14:47 EDT","","Harvey Hunter","Cryptonews Blockchain News India’s SEBI Open to Crypto Oversight, RBI Seeks Stablecoin Ban Harvey Hunter      SEBI’s proposition The RBI sees private digital currencies As per the Reuters report ICOs #SEBI #crypto #RBI #Crypto #GOI pic.twitter.com/cWQ40rQJ7W May 16, 2024 regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to insurance and pensions tough stance on cryptocurrencies the government prepared a bill global framework macroeconomic risk The Hindu reported tax evasion introduce a crypto tax Follow Us on Google News Crypto ban Reserve Bank of India"

Thursday’s vote garnered considerable bipartisan support, with Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Booker (NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) voting in favor of the effective “reversal” of the stringent digital asset guidelines.
The Senate passing a CRA overturning SAB 121 is a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the way the Biden admin and Gary Gensler have persecuted crypto.
It also marks the 1st time Congress has passed standalone crypto legislation.
We are just getting started.
— Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) May 16, 2024

Championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), the vote comes just a little over a week after the House voted on a companion bill brought forth by Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE) and Wiley Nickel (D-NC).
“SAB 121 sets a disturbing precedent and is not the appropriate vehicle to promulgate accounting guidance for digital asset custodians,” Flood said in testimony earlier this month.
The resolution is now headed to President Joe Biden’s desk, though the legislation’s success seems grim following a May 8 letter from the White House saying Biden would veto it.
“Limiting the SEC’s ability to maintain a comprehensive and effective financial regulatory framework for crypto-assets would introduce substantial financial instability and market uncertainty,” the letter read.
The SEC claims SAB121 is meant to safeguard digital asset use, though crypto-friendly lawmakers have pushed back against the federal agency’s rhetoric.
Critics argue that capital requirements on financial institutions brought forward by SAB121 go too far, with banks required to list clients’ custody assets with liabilities on their balance sheets.
“Limiting banks’ ability to offer these services leaves customers with few well-regulated, trusted options for safeguarding their digital asset portfolios and ultimately exposes them to increased risk,” the Securities Industries and Financial Markets Association said in a May 14 letter.
Lawmakers have further condemned the commission’s failure to follow procedural rules in SAB121’s creation as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently found that the SEC did not report the rule change under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

“It is unfortunate that the SEC would attempt to circumvent the rulemaking process while falsely claiming that SAB 121 is simply non-binding staff-level guidance,” Flood continued.
While Biden may veto the resolution to nullify SAB121, Thursday’s strong show of bipartisan support for the resolution may prove hopeful for advancing crypto legislation in general.
“The second most powerful democrat in the country Sen.

The integration with Shibarium enhances ShibaSwap’s functionality by combining Shibarium’s scalability and cost-efficiency with Ethereum’s established security and robustness. This synergy allows users to optimize their trading strategies and liquidity management, achieving new levels of efficiency and effectiveness.
A significant aspect of the ShibaSwap upgrade is its potential to accelerate SHIB burns. Every transaction and staking action on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem, with increased trading volumes resulting in higher fees for stakers and liquidity providers.
As transaction activity on Shibarium grows, the protocol will incinerate base gas fees, potentially increasing the burn rate of the SHIB token. This mechanism could enhance the token’s scarcity and valu
